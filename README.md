## Overview

The app enables quick and easy note-saving with a timestamp, search functionality, and the ability to organize notes by categories. It‚Äôs designed to get users back to work swiftly by allowing them to focus on their task, not on the process of taking notes.

## Why it was made
 The application was created to address the needs of individuals with ADHD. The goal was to provide a simple, distraction-free environment where users could write down their thoughts quickly, ensuring they could return to their primary work without losing focus. By streamlining the process of taking notes, Speed Notes makes it easier to capture important ideas in an efficient manner.

## Dependencies

## Description of Operation
 **Add a Note:** Users can type notes into the large text area at the top of the screen. Once finished, they can press Enter to save the note automatically.
